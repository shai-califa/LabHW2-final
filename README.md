Trying to predict if a mask is worn correctly and segment it.</br>
netD is the simple network, to run this model set the model_type variable at predict.py to 'small'.</br>
netDt4 is the resNet like network, to run this model set the model_type variable at predict.py to 'big'.</br>
main.py is the training code supplied here for comleteness do not run it. It may override existing models. It also includes failed attempts.</br>
We used a program called lfs to upload the model files if after clonning they are corupted you can find working models at:</br>
netD:

and</br>
netDt4:
